# Animations with receiver operating characteristic and precision-recal curves 

## Usage
Please feel free to use the animations and scripts in this repository for teaching or learning. You can directly download the [gif files](animations) for any of the animations, or you can recreate them using these [scripts](R). Each script is named according to the animation it generates (i.e. `animate_ROC.r` generates `ROC.gif`, `animate_SD.r` generates `SD.gif`, etc.).

## Receiver operating characteristic curve

A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve displays how well a model can classify binary outcomes. For example, let's assume we make a model to distinguish between benign and malignant tumor samples. An ROC curve demonstrates how well this model can tell whether a benign tumor is benign and whether a malignant tumor is malignant. 

An ROC curve is made by plotting a false positive rate against a true positive rate for each possible cutoff value. In my tumor example, a cutoff value is a value that seperates benign and malignant outcomes. If we assume that the positive outcome is malignant, a predictor value above the cutoff would classify a tumor as malignant, and a predictor value below the cutoff would classify a tumor as benign. In this example, the true positive rate is the fraction of malignant tumors that were correctly identified as malignant, and the false positive rate is the fraction of benign tumors that were incorrectly identified as malignant.

The plot on the left shows the distributions of predictors for the two outcomes, and the plot on the right shows the ROC curve for these distributions. The vertical line that travels left-to-right is the cutoff value. The red dot that travels along the ROC curve corresponds to the false positive rate and the true positive rate for the cutoff value given in the plot on the left. 

The traveling cutoff demonstrates the trade-off between trying to classify one outcome correctly and trying to classify the other outcome correcly. When we try to increase the true positive rate, we also increase the false positive rate. When we try to decrease the false positive rate, we decrease the true positive rate. 

"AUC" at the top of the right plot stands for "area under the curve". AUC tells us the area under an ROC curve, and, generally, an AUC value over 0.7 is indicative of a model that can distinguish between the two outcomes well. An AUC of 0.5 tells us that the model is a random classifier, and it cannot distinguish between the two outcomes. 

The shape of an ROC curve changes when a model changes the way it classifies the two outcomes.

The animation starts with a model that cannot tell one outcome from the other, and the two distributions completely overlap (essentially a random classifier). As the two distributions separate, the ROC curve approaches the left-top corner, and the AUC value of the curve increases. When the model can perfectly separate the two outcomes, the ROC curve forms a right angle and the AUC becomes 1. 

## Precision-recall curve

Precision-recall curve also displays how well a model can classify binary outcomes. However, it does it differently from the way an ROC curve does. Precision-recall curve plots true positive rate (recall or sensitivity) against the positive predictive value (precision). Positive predictive value is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of total positive calls, and it is meant to measure the positive outcomes that were called correctly among all positive results. The shape of the precision-recall curve also changes when a model changes the way it classifies the two outcomes.

Similarly to the ROC curve, when the two outcomes separate, precision-recall curve will approach the top-right corner. Typically, a model that produces a precision-recall curve that is closer to the top-right corner is better than a model that produces a precision-recall curve that is skewed towards the bottom of the plot.

## Precision-recall curve is more sensitive to class imbalanace than an ROC curve

Class imbalance happens when the number of outputs in one class is different from the number of outputs in another class. For example, one of the distributions has 1000 observations and the other has 10. An ROC curve tends to be more robust to class imbalanace that a precision-recall curve.

In this animation, both distributions start with 1000 outcomes. The blue one is then reduced to 50. The precision-recall curve changes shape more drastically than the ROC curve, and the AUC value mostly stays the same. We also observe this behaviour when the other disribution is reduced to 50.

## AUC value can be misleading 

When the standard deviation of one of the outcomes changes, an ROC curve and its AUC value also change. In the following animation, when the standard deviation of the blue distribution is decreased, the ROC curve shifts upwards, and its AUC value increases. This should indicate that the model performance has increased, when, in fact, the prediction performance has worsened at small false positive rates.
